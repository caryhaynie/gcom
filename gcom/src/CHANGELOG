This file contains a transcript of the changes I made to go from Elate
version of GCOM 0.3 to the Linux version of GCOM 0.3.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Changed all WCHAR to wchar in the following files:

	unicode.c
	misc.c
	init.c
	dll.c
	class.c

2.  Change license comment block in the following files:

	unicode.c
	misc.c
	init.c
	dll.c
	class.c
	alloc.c

3.  Change all the <gcom/*> includes to simply use <gcom/gcom.h>

4.  Deleted reg.c -- it's simply not being used anymore.

5.  Changed <gcom/lists.h> to <util/lists.h> in:

	dll.c
	alloc.c
	lists.c
