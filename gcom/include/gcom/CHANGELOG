1.  re-engineered the types.h file to include #if statements guarding the
    definitions of (u)int(8|16|32), and introduced (u)int64 for the first time.

2.  Introduced the lowercase type wchar, typedef'ed from wchar_t.

3.  In unicode.h, I removed WCHAR and OLECHAR, since wchar is now in
    types.h.  Also cleaned up the prototypes section of the unicode.h file.

4.  Removed unsupported functions from the registry.h file.
