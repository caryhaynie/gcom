What you've seen in this example is actually pretty rarely ever hand-coded
anymore on other platforms.  Regular use of tools like Interface Description
Language (IDL) compilers helps automate the drudgery of creating COM object
implementations by converting descriptive text files into the appropriate
collection of source files suitable for your target platform.  In addition,
using IDL compilers can take advantage of platform-specific extensions.
Consider co-classes under Windows, and the newly created COM+ extensions,
which succeed in making COM implementations far easier than we've
demonstrated here.  There is nothing standing in the way of such extensions
being made for GCOM either, except public acceptance.
